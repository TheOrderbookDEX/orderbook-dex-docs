# *The Orderbook DEX* **V1**

## Features

  * It allows **Limit Orders**.

  * Orders **at market** are executed **immediately** when possible, working similarly to a **swap**.

  * Almost all functions are **O(1) complexity**.

    > This means that the **gas needed** for these functions is always equal or below a predetermined **constant** value.

  * Order ownership can be **transferred**.

    > This also means that an order can be wrapped as an **NFT**.

## Trade-offs

  * It **only** allows Limit Orders.

  * Order placers must **lock** the funds to be traded.

  * **Canceling** an order is **O(n) complexity**.

    > Where **n** is relative to the amount of **orders after yours**.
    >
    > Which means the more orders after yours, the **more gas** will be needed to cancel it.

## Considerations

  * Keep in mind that the funds you are locking in for trading might remain locked **for a long time**.

  * It might take some time for people to start canceling orders from a price point that has **moved away from market**, which would give you a chance to cancel for a **viable gas cost**.

  * Since order ownership can be transferred, you might be able to exit a position by **trading your order**, either directly or by wrapping the **order as an NFT**.

  * [*The Orderbook DEX* **V2**](V2.md) might be a better option if you are interested in **short-term trading**.
