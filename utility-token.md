# The Utility Token

## What is its purpose?

  * To **finance** *The Orderbook DEX* project.

    > *The Orderbook DEX Team* will be able to finance the project through **vested token reserves**.

  * To **compensate** the users who end up having to do **extra work** to keep the DEX working.

    > When the DEX requires some of its users to **ocasionally** do extra work, they'll be **rewarded** tokens collected from other users as **fees**.

  * To allow users to **participate** in the running of a DEX through **staking**.

    > When the DEX requires its users to run **maintenance** functions to keep it running, the users will have to **stake tokens** to be able to do so and get **fees** as a reward.
    >
    > Staked tokens would also act as **collateral** to keep the participants honest.

## What is it not?

  * It is **not** a **governance** token.

    > Though we are open to it **in the future**.

## Regarding Chains & Bridges

  * We are **not** going to use **bridges**.

    > We don't want the DEX to be **dependent** on a bridge. Not until we are sure this won't **compromise** the DEX's **decentralization**. We are open to revise this in the future.
    >
    > Meanwhile, we would rather explore **alternative solutions** to cross-chain interactions. Check [The Roadmap](roadmap.md) to learn more about it.

  * Total supply of tokens will **not increase**.

    > New tokens might be created for the purpose of **upgrading** or **deploying to new chains**, but the total supply will remain the same when doing so.

  * When deploying *The Orderbook DEX* on a **new chain**, token holders will be given a chance to **transfer tokens** to the new chain by **burning them** in another.

    > Keep in mind this is a **one-way** transfer.

  * *The Orderbook DEX Team* will also have a chance to transfer **vested tokens** to the new chain while keeping the same **vesting rules**.

    > This is to make sure that a chain might not end up **undersupplied** with tokens. Vested tokens will **remain locked** the time they are expected to.
