# *The Orderbook DEX*

## What is *The Orderbook DEX*?

*The Orderbook DEX* project's main objective is to develop **viable** and **fully decentralized** exchanges with **orderbook functionality** that work on the **EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine).

  * By **viable** we mean not only its **practical viability** but also its **economic viability**.

    > The gas cost of using it should be **predictable** and **reasonable**.

  * By **fully decentralized** we mean in particular that it should **not depend** on a third party or organization (either centralized or decentralized) to operate.

  * By **orderbook functionality** we mean that it should work as similar as possible as a **traditional orderbook** exchange.

    > **Liquidity** should be provided **organically** by the market, and orders are filled **honoring the order** in which they were placed.

## How will it be implemented?

  * **Several versions** of *The Orderbook DEX* are to be developed, where each major version is not necessarily an extension, improvement, or upgrade of the previous one, but an **entirely new approach** to the same problem.

  * The **objective** is not to provide direct replacements of the previous version but **alternatives**, each with their own **balancing of features** and aimed at different market players and use cases.

  * **Exchanges** running different versions can either indirectly affect each other through **arbitrage** or be made to work together as one exchange through an **integration interface**.
