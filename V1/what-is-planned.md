# What is planned for **V1**?

## Feedback Phase

  * We will monitor how **V1** is being used, with a focus on the **UX** quality.

  * We will collect **feedback** from its users.

  * From all of this we will try to determine where **optimizations** are actually required, or if **extra functionality** is needed.

## Revision and Optimization Phase

  * We will implement any optimization or functionality alteration deemed necessary by the **Feedback Phase**.

  * We will at this stage introduce changes that will reduce the code's **readability** in favor of **performance**.

## Integration Phase

  * After **V2** is released we will work on mechanisms for making **V1** and **V2** work together.

  * This integration might be **external**, a **common gateway** for interacting with a **V1** and **V2** orderbook as if they were one.

  * Alternatively, an integration might be a modification of **V1** which allows for a deeper connection with a **V2** orderbook.
